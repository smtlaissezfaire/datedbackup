trunk:
[2007.08.01]
- many misc. bug fixes
- documentation added in README file
- Backup Deletion now seems to work (almost too well)
- warnings turned off for DSL

[2007.07.21]
- removed dependency on GNU cp, so now we can DatedBackup on Mac OS X
- outputting of deleted directories
- fixed small bugs

[2007.07.25]
- ExecutionContext class added, so now the separate parts of the DSL
  can execute in separate contexts.  The Execution Contexts
  will execute the DSL in an anonymous class + instance, so methods
  used to run the DSL do not need be included.  The DSL's themselves
  have become modules, mixed in to the anonymous classes.  
  Work still needs to be done on calling these, both from the initial
  call in /bin, and later on in the DatedBackup class.
  
- Any number of scripts can now be passed to the dbackup command line
  utility.  So specify the scripts one after another:
  dbackup script1 script2 script3
  
[2007.07.20]
- Added basic DSL configuration, so no more rake for config files
  Documentation via Rake, Rcov, and the spec reports are now
  available in doc/
  specs have been added, and code coverage is now at 100%
  
[2007.07.15]
- YAML support.  Now all configuration files are written in yaml, and
  should be loaded by running dbackup config_file.yaml

[2007.07.12] 
- Command line runner, dbackup added to bin.  Scripts can now be called
  with the dbackup script_name.  Scripts no longer have to include
  the requirement of the gem, be executable, or end in .rb syntax.
