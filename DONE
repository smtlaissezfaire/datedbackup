ExecutionContext class added, so now the separate parts of the DSL
can execute in separate contexts.  The Execution Contexts
will execute the DSL in an anonymous class + instance, so methods
used to run the DSL do not need be included.  The DSL's themselves
have become modules, mixed in to the anonymous classes.  
Work still needs to be done on calling these, both from the initial
call in /bin, and later on in the DatedBackup class.

2007.07.20
Added basic DSL configuration, so no more rake for config files
Documentation via Rake, Rcov, and the spec reports are now
available in doc/
specs have been added, and code coverage is now at 100%

2007.07.15
YAML support.  Now all configuration files are written in yaml, and
should be loaded by running dbackup config_file.yaml

2007.07.12 - 
Command line runner, dbackup added to bin.  Scripts can now be called
with the dbackup script_name.  Scripts no longer have to include
the requirement of the gem, be executable, or end in .rb syntax.
