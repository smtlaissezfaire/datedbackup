Dated Backup is a small class which does exactly what it's name says: 
It creates backups of any directory, timestamping the backups, and then 
performing incremental backups on any subsequent runs.  The really nice thing here 
is that those backups are fully viewable as snapshots, even though they are 
also incremental.

This method of backup requires GNU's cp (so Mac OS X is out), and it also
requires rsync.  For more information on this technique, see: 

  http://www.mikerubel.org/computers/rsync_snapshots/
  
For some example scripts, see the example_scripts directory.  The 
scripts can be run with the command dbackup:

% dbackup my_first_script my_second_script
