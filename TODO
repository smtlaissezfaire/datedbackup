- build website for dbackup (webgen?)

- include example scripts in rdoc (link to, in the future, since they get mangled)
- gem generation should include all documentation
- Parameter in config to name backups, + output this when running
- only operate on Timestamped directories, not other directories
- remove unix dependency - try to remove as many Kernel.` calls as possible
    - after this is done, fix the output to the 'execute' method
- change ReverseSortedArray so that it has a callback mechanism - every time a 
  method changes the internal representation of the data, the data
  gets resorted and checked for uniqueness
- get heckle to work.  Right now it recurs infinitely
- lots of error checking needs to occur
- use rbehave to perform integration tests
- add umimplemented specs


DSL aliases:  
- from this day => alias for todays backups, from today
- from last day => alias for yesterdays, from yesterday
- weeklies, monthlies => weekly, monthly

- execute_script functions in before and after
- include + exclude rules
- execute_command(s)
- a logger for subversion like logs
- permissions
- transactions?
