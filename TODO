fix bugs
remove warnings

only create new directory when the root directory has no dated backup
  this way, another directory can still be used inside of here &
  dated backups will still occur
  
from this day => alias for todays backups, from today
from last day => alias for yesterdays, from yesterday

remove unix dependency - try to remove as many Kernel.` calls as possible

change ReverseSortedArray so that it has a callback mechanism - every time a 
method changes the internal representation of the data, the data
gets resorted and checked for uniqueness

heckle - does not work, as it leads to an infinite recursion

need to add alot of error checking

features:
execute_script functions in before and after
execute_command(s)
a logger for subversion like logs
permissions
transactions?
