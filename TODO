- minor tweaks to the DSL.  
- build website for dbackup on rubyforge
- exclude example scripts in rdoc (in the future we should link to them,
  since rdoc/SimpleText mangles them)
- better dsl for backup removal + explicit remove message
- release a 1.0 (it has been used for a while now, in a production setting)

- gem generation should include all documentation
- Parameter in config to name backups, + output this when running
- only operate on Timestamped directories, not other directories
- some extra error checking (where?)
- -t flag to simulate running
- remove unix dependency - try to remove as many Kernel.` calls as possible
    - after this is done, fix the output to the 'execute' method

DSL aliases:  
- execute_script functions in before and after
- include + exclude rules
- execute_command(s)
- a logger for subversion like logs
- permissions
- transactions?
